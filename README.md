# Code Challenge

This project was generated as a coding assignment for Charon Tech. This site in no way is associated with the Charon Tech. All commands should work below except for testing. 

Please note that you will need to install JSON Server(https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to simulate backend data.  
npm install -g json-server
After Json-server install, please run command '$ json-server --watch db.json --port 3004'. The Port must be set to 3004.

Please install Angular Cli(https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and run 'ng serve'. Some magic should happen on port 4200.

Thank you.
